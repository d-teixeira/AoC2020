    "Throughout this notebook, I will be posting all my codes for the different Advent of Code challenges. Since I am doing this for learning purposes, I will post my original code, successful or not, efficient or not, and will try to search for better solutions of other programmers to increase my awareness of libraries, methods, functions, best practices and so on. In the end, I expect this notebook to be helpful for my future self and, maybe, for others too."
